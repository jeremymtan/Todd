Collaboration with Kevin Cui, Finance major with minor in Computer Science. You can contact him at kc3313@stern.nyu.edu!

Todd is a Facebook Messenger chatbot built using Python that tries to make the user smile through a joke, meme, and various other addons. This utilizes the praw module in particular to scrap data from the Reddit website to send to the user! This ML bot classifies sentence structures based on key words to understand what the user wants from it. 

This is all imported from my Heroku Git repository into my Github Git repository! Big thanks to Conbus with the Facebook Chatbot Library. You can find it here:  https://github.com/conbus/fbmq!

Pending release for Messenger currently and still a work in progress.
